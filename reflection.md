# Reflection

The goal of a reflection is to improve.

One does so writing down how a passed day went:
what did yo do, how did it go and how can it be improved?

By forcing oneself to think of this, one can actually learn from the past.

## What did you do?

I made a flamegraph using the programming language python. I needed a python code to make a flamegraph so I searched until I found a good python code.

## What did you do well?

I listen well and when I got help I understood the problem. 

## What can be improved?

I could have improved by working harder. Also I needed a lot of help because at the start i was so confused I panicked a bit in my head. So next time i should be more calm and try to focus.

## What did you supervisor do well?

He did great when I needed help, cause when I got help from him i just understood it. He also did with planning this out for me and also made me learn more than just flamegraphs. He makes me understand my problems.

## How can you supervisor be improved?

I can't think of anything to improve so maybe the next student does, but so far nothing.

## What would you do differently next time?

I Would stay more calm and focus on the goals of the prao. Also I would try to ask more stuff and talk more so that I dont just sit there doing nothing.

## Which tip would you give to future PRAO students?

Stay calm and focused and you will get it done, even if it feels stressful you'll get it done in the end. Remember the goal of a prao. The start is the hardest, it gets easier.
