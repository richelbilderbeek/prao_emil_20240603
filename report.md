# Report

Goal of a PRAO is to find out how it is like to work at a certain place.

This PRAO has two parts:

- work: work on something yourself
- interviews: find out how others like the place

## Code

Here at NBIS and UPPMAX, we do many different things.
A thing I need is [select thing]:

- [X] Create a [flamegraph](images/example_flamegraph.png)
  of code runtime.
  Find/write an example of well-written Python code
  that shows a run-time speed bottleneck
  at an unexpected location.
  Adapt text at <https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms/optimisation/runtime_speed_profiles/>
- [ ] Do the exercises at <https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms/optimisation/big_o/> ,
  add these to the course materials
- [ ] Finish the Programming Formalisms example project at <https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_example_project>
- [ ] Convert some private notes to documentation on how to
  transfer data to Swestore


## Interviews

Here at NBIS and UPPMAX, we do many different things,
done by a diverse group of people with different opinions.
These people have signed up to have a chat with you,
so you can find out.

Some colleagues have planned an activity to do,
so will improvise and discuss their work.

If there is time, try to answer these questions per person.
