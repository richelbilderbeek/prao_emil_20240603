## FAQ for colleagues

### What is the purpose of meeting the PRAO student?

To show the diversity within our workplace.

The goal for the PRAO student is to find out how working at
university/NBIS/UPPMAX looks like. I (Richel) think that
we do widely different things and have widely different
opinions and personality. Hence, I hope the PRAO student
meets a lot of colleagues.

### What should I do with the PRAO student?

The goal of a PRAO is to find out how our working life
looks like.

You can already do so by having him come to your office and
talk about your job. You can also use the PRAO student
to do work you'd give to a new colleague.

### How do I book some time with the PRAO student?

In many ways:

- Send a Slack PM to Richel Bilderbeek
- Send an email to `richel.bilderbeek@icm.uu.se`
- Create an Issue at this repo
- Create a Pull Request to this repo,
  putting yourself in a slot in [the schedule](schedule.md)

### How long can I have the PRAO student?

At least one slot at most all slots in two days.

- One slot, because it allows for straightforward scheduling
- Two days, because it allows for meeting many colleagues

### Help, I must cancel last-minute

No worries, just let Richel or the PRAO student know.
