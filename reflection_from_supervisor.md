# Reflection from supervisor

## What I did well

I think I gave a lot of structure to Emil, 
with a crystal-clear schedule. 
I also had a 5-day-plan:
I'd challenge him at the start with a complex and open problem
(so he'd feel what it is to do my job), 
then helped him more and more (so he'd learn how to solve such
a problem in the future).

## What I could do better

I am very happy with how it went. 
I do not see (yet) what I could have done better.

## My conclusion about Emil

Emil was a great PRAO, for many reasons:

- Emil is polite: during his PRAO Emil interviewed multiple colleagues
  and this is what I heard from them
- Emil is on time. Only once was he 3 minutes late, but more often,
  we started a bit earlier
- Emil takes responsibility. Once we agreed upon him taking a break 6 minutes
  earlier and then start 6 minutes earlier. For some reason, Emil 'only'
  started on time. We decided to start 6 minutes earlier the day after.
  And he, indeed, did start 6 minutes earlier. 
- Emil did not give up. Even though he had a challenging job,
  he kept trying
- Emil learned. With some help from me in giving definitions for complex
  things, he now has shown to partially understand his job
- Emil was honest. In his interviews, he writes down if he'd like the
  job of my colleague and this was not always a -just to be nice- yes 

I will recommend Emil to any other PRAO supervisor.
